## Features

- Flexible ChargeCode system with no limits on the number of codes you can define.
- Simple method to "punch" a ChargeCode. Punching logs the current timestamp and changes the "state" of the ChargeCode (active/passive or "on/off the clock").
- All data is stored locally! It's yours, you have complete control over it! There's no online backups, no phoning home, no licensing.
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) for creating, listing, and punching in/out of charge codes.

## Requirements

- No major requirements. If you have a Python version >= 3.8, you're good to go! Check out the installation section below.
- Being familiar with the command-line is a plus. If the terminal scares you, this might not be the right tool for you.
- Thymed uses [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) for console markup. A modern terminal will make output much prettier! :wink:
